🔍 Credit Card Fraud Detection – EDA Project
📌 Project Overview

Fraudulent transactions are a serious challenge for banks and financial institutions, leading to financial losses and reduced customer trust. This project applies Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on credit card transaction data to uncover hidden fraud patterns. Through visualization and statistical insights, the project explores unusual spending behaviors, suspicious timings, and location mismatches that help distinguish fraudulent transactions from genuine ones.

🎯 Objectives
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
Handle imbalanced classes between fraud and non-fraud cases
Explore statistical summaries of transaction features
Create visualizations to identify fraud patterns
Highlight insights for future predictive modeling

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized credit card transaction records.
It includes transaction amount, time, and several anonymized features.
The target variable indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or genuine (0).

📊 Key Insights from EDA
Fraudulent transactions often show spending spikes.
Location mismatches and odd timings are common fraud indicators.
Feature correlations reveal strong differences between fraud and non-fraud behavior.
Visualizations highlight how fraud is rare but significantly different in distribution.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas & NumPy – Data handling
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization
Scikit-learn – Preprocessing

🚀 Future Scope
While this project focuses on EDA, the insights provide a strong base for building machine learning models that can predict and prevent fraud in real-time.
📎 How to Use
